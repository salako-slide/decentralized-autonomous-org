;; title: Bitcoin-Powered DAO
;; version: 1.0.0
;; summary: A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) powered by Bitcoin, enabling members to stake tokens, create and vote on proposals, and manage a treasury.
;; description: 
;; This smart contract implements a Bitcoin-powered DAO where members can join, leave, stake tokens, and participate in governance by creating and voting on proposals. The contract manages a treasury and supports cross-DAO collaborations. Key features include:
;; - Membership management: join, leave, stake, and unstake tokens.
;; - Proposal management: create, vote, and execute proposals.
;; - Treasury management: donate to the treasury and manage funds.
;; - Cross-DAO collaboration: propose and accept collaborations with other DAOs.
;; - Reputation system: members earn reputation for participating in governance activities.
