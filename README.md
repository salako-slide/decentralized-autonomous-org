# Bitcoin-Powered DAO Smart Contract

## Overview

This smart contract implements a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) powered by Bitcoin, providing a robust framework for collaborative governance, treasury management, and cross-DAO interactions.

## Features

### 1. Membership Management

- Join and leave the DAO
- Stake and unstake tokens
- Track member reputation and interactions

### 2. Proposal System

- Create proposals with titles and descriptions
- Vote on proposals with weighted voting power
- Execute or reject proposals based on voting results
- Proposal lifecycle management

### 3. Treasury Management

- Donate tokens to the DAO treasury
- Manage and track treasury balance
- Spend treasury funds through proposal execution

### 4. Reputation System

- Members earn reputation through:
  - Creating proposals
  - Voting
  - Donating to the treasury
- Reputation decays for inactive members

### 5. Cross-DAO Collaboration

- Propose collaborations with other DAOs
- Accept and manage inter-DAO proposals

## Key Components

### Constants

- Error codes for various validation checks
- Contract owner definition

### Data Structures

- `members`: Tracks member information (reputation, stake, last interaction)
- `proposals`: Stores proposal details
- `votes`: Tracks member votes on proposals
- `collaborations`: Manages cross-DAO collaboration proposals

## Functions

### Membership Functions

- `join-dao()`: Allow a user to become a DAO member
- `leave-dao()`: Allow a member to exit the DAO
- `stake-tokens(amount)`: Stake tokens in the DAO
- `unstake-tokens(amount)`: Withdraw staked tokens

### Proposal Functions

- `create-proposal(title, description, amount)`: Create a new proposal
- `vote-on-proposal(proposal-id, vote)`: Vote on an existing proposal
- `execute-proposal(proposal-id)`: Execute or reject a proposal after voting

### Treasury Functions

- `donate-to-treasury(amount)`: Contribute tokens to the DAO treasury
- `get-treasury-balance()`: Retrieve current treasury balance

### Collaboration Functions

- `propose-collaboration(partner-dao, proposal-id)`: Propose a collaboration with another DAO
- `accept-collaboration(collaboration-id)`: Accept a cross-DAO collaboration proposal

### Utility Functions

- `decay-inactive-members()`: Reduce reputation for long-inactive members
- Various read-only functions to query DAO state

## Reputation Mechanism

The contract implements a dynamic reputation system:

- Initial reputation: 1 point when joining
- Gain reputation by:
  - Creating a proposal: +1 point
  - Voting on a proposal: +1 point
  - Donating to treasury: +2 points
  - Executing a successful proposal: +5 points for the creator
- Reputation decays by 50% after 30 days of inactivity

## Voting Power Calculation

Voting power is calculated as: `(reputation * 10) + stake`

- Ensures both long-term commitment and financial investment are considered

## Security Considerations

- Role-based access control
- Multiple validation checks
- Prevents double voting
- Protects against unauthorized treasury access

## Contract Initialization

- Starts with zero members, proposals, and treasury balance

## Error Handling

Comprehensive error codes cover scenarios like:

- Unauthorized actions
- Already existing members
- Invalid proposals
- Insufficient funds
- Voting restrictions

## Deployment

- Deployed on the Stacks blockchain
- Requires STX tokens for transactions
- Contract owner has special permissions
